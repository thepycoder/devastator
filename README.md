# Prerequisites

Building devastator requires the following software installed:

* A C++17-compliant compiler
* CMake `>= 3.9`
* Doxygen (optional, documentation building is skipped if missing)

# Building devastator

The following sequence of commands builds devastator.
It assumes that your current working directory is the top-level directory
of the freshly cloned repository:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```

The build process can be customized with the following CMake variables,
which can be set by adding `-D<var>={ON, OFF}` to the `cmake` call:

* `BUILD_TESTING`: Enable building of the test suite (default: `ON`)
* `BUILD_DOCS`: Enable building the documentation (default: `ON`)

# Documentation

devastator provides a Doxygen documentation. You can build
the documentation locally by making sure that `Doxygen` is installed on your system
and running this command from the top-level build directory:

```
cmake --build . --target doxygen
```

The web documentation can then be browsed by opening `doc/html/index.html` in your browser.
